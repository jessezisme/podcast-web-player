# PodNexus

**[Live Link](https://podcast-web-player.onrender.com)**

A podcast web app with search and play functionality.

If a podcast fails to play, it's likely the result of the podcast API returning the episode, but it has since been deleted by the publisher; the audio is 404'ing.

## Built With

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - Front-end JavaScript framework.
- [Listen Notes](https://www.listennotes.com/) - Podcast API (finally, a good one!).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - I'm sure you've heard of it.
